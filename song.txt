It's a mystery to me
The game commences
For the usual fee
Plus expenses
Confidential information
It's in a diary
This is my investigation
It's not a public inquiry
I go checking out the reports
Digging up the dirt
You get to meet all sorts
In this line of work
Treachery and treason
There's always an excuse for it
And when I find the reason
I still can't get used to it
And what have you got
At the end of the day?
What have you got
To take away?
A bottle of whisky
And a new set of lies
Blinds on a window
And a pain behind the eyes
Scarred for life
No compensation
Private investigations
